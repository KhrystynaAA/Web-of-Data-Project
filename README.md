# Web-of-Data-Project

This project aims to identify the European capital with a population between
500,000 and 1 million that is within 50 km of the highest number of UNESCO
heritage sites. The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into which
capital city with a medium population is most suitable for visiting multiple
UNESCO heritage sites within a short distance.

All necessary information about the project can be found in the file **reportWODProject.pdf**
